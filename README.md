## About Me

I'm a software developer based out of San Antonio, Texas. I specialized in building websites using HTML and CSS code. Having a background in engineering and customer relations, I have develop important problem solving skills throughout the years. These skills have transformed me into the software developer I am today. I have a Bachelor's Degree in Mechanical Engineering from Texas A&M University. I spent the first 5 years post-graduation working on communication/speaking skills working in the retail automotive industry. Since then, I am pursuing a software development certificate from University of Texas at San Antonio. My personal interests include travelling and video gaming. I am passionate about both and plan to pursue a career in software in one of those two industries. Incorporating both industries would be ideal.

Below is a list of work to showcase my skills as a developer. You will see a link to Run-Buddy, an interactive website designed to encourage people to participate in a fitness program. Using HTML and CSS, potential customers are provided with a website that is informative, engaging, and responsive. Click on the link below to see just how the website works.
