                <p>
                    I'm a software developer based out of San Antonio, Texas. I specialized in building websites using HTML and CSS code. Having a background in engineering and customer relations, I have develop important
                    problem solving skills throughout the years. These skills have transformed me into the software developer I am today. I have a Bachelor's Degree in Mechanical Engineering from Texas A&M University. I spent
                    the first 5 years post-graduation working on communication/speaking skills working in the retail automotive industry. Since then, I am pursuing a software development certificate from University of Texas at
                    San Antonio.

                <p>
                    My personal interests include travelling and video gaming. I am passionate about both and plan to pursue a career in software in one of those two industries. Incorporating both industries would be ideal. Growing up
                    playing video games, I developed a passion at an early age. There is nothing like losing track of time at night becoming consumed by an additive game. One minute it's 9:00pm, the next time you look at the time it's 3:00am. 
                    That feeling of "where did the time go" motivates me to find a career that does the same. I have found that in software development.
